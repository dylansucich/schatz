Challenge 2: Reads to Expression
--------------------------------

Dr. Jones is interested to identify which of her favorite 100 genes in E.coli are differentially expressed over 10 timepoints.
See if you can't help her out!

Input Files:

1. ecoli.fa is the reference genome
2. refgenes.ptt has a list of the 100 genes of interest
3. tX.1.fq, tX.2.fq are the paired-end RNAseq reads collected from timepoint X for 1<=X<=10. 

The reads are 50bp long from 200bp fragments with errors at a constant 2% error rate.


Outputs:

1. Construct an expression matrix with the average depth of coverage across each gene
2. Plot of expression matrix (parallel coordinates, heatmap, etc)
3. List of neutral, increasing, decreasing, and other "interesting"  genes. 


Sketch:

Index genome (bwa index)
For each time point
  Align reads to genome (bwa aln, bwa sampe)
  Convert and sort alignments (samtools view, samtools sort)
  Report coverage at each position samtools (samtools depth)
  Compute average depth of each exon (your own code)
Merge depths into expression matrix (your own code)
Display heatmap / timeseries, identify special genes (your own R code)

Good luck!
